# Asfah_Project
this is a final project for data science class 
This project focuses on analyzing Artificial Intelligence (AI) job trends. Leveraging Python within Google Colab, we perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and data modeling. The core objective is to identify patterns and insights within AI job market data to understand current trends and future directions.

**FEATURES**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis to uncover initial insights and understand data distributions.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Robust cleaning and transformation of raw data, including handling of mixed data types.
3. **Binary Conversion for Nominal Data**: Specific handling of non-numerical categorical features by converting them into a binary format to ensure model compatibility.
4. **Random Forest Modeling**: Utilization of the powerful Random Forest algorithm for robust data modeling and trend prediction.
5. **Google Colab Integration**: Fully executable and reproducible in Google Colab, making it easy to run and explore.

**TECHNPLOGIES USED**
1. Python 3.x
2. Google Colab
3. Pandas (for data manipulation)
4. NumPy (for numerical operations)
5. Scikit-learn (for machine learning models, particularly Random Forest)
6. Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization during EDA)

**GETTING STARTED**
To run this project, you'll need a Google account to access Google Colab.
1. **Open the Notebook**:
- Navigate to the .ipynb file in this repository (e.g., ai_job_trends_analysis.ipynb).
- Open it directly in Google Colab by clicking the "Open in Colab" badge or by uploading it to your Google Drive and opening it with Colab.
2. **Run All Cells**:
- Once the notebook is open in Colab, go to Runtime -> Run all.
- Ensure you have an internet connection, as some dependencies or datasets might be fetched during execution.
